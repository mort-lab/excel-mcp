# PRP Core Workflow Runner

## Instructions

When the user requests to implement a feature using the PRP workflow or wants end-to-end automation from idea to PR, use the SlashCommand tool to invoke `/prp-core-run-all` with the user's feature description as the argument.

**Step-by-step execution:**

1. **Invoke the workflow**: Use SlashCommand tool with `/prp-core-run-all {feature-description}`
2. **Monitor progress**: The workflow will execute 5 steps in sequence:
   - Create a conventional git branch
   - Generate comprehensive PRP document
   - Execute the PRP implementation
   - Create atomic git commit
   - Create pull request
3. **Handle failures**: If any step fails:
   - Report which step failed and why
   - Do NOT proceed to subsequent steps
   - Provide actionable guidance for fixing the issue
4. **Report completion**: When all steps succeed, confirm the workflow completed and provide the PR URL

**Error Handling:**

- Stop execution immediately if any validation fails
- Report the specific error clearly
- Guide the user on how to resolve the issue
- Do not attempt to auto-fix complex validation failures

## Examples

**Example 1: Autonomous invocation**

```
User: "Can you implement user authentication using JWT with the PRP workflow?"
Assistant: I'll use the prp-core-runner skill to execute the complete PRP workflow for implementing JWT authentication.
[Invokes: /prp-core-run-all Implement user authentication using JWT]
```

**Example 2: Feature request**

```
User: "I need to add a search API with Elasticsearch integration using PRP"
Assistant: I'll run the full PRP workflow to implement the search API with Elasticsearch.
[Invokes: /prp-core-run-all Add search API with Elasticsearch integration]
```

**Example 3: Refactoring with PRP**

```
User: "Use the PRP methodology to refactor the database layer for better performance"
Assistant: I'll execute the PRP workflow for refactoring the database layer.
[Invokes: /prp-core-run-all Refactor database layer for better performance]
```

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- User explicitly requests to "implement a feature using PRP"
- User asks to "run the full PRP workflow"
- User wants end-to-end automation from feature idea to pull request
- User mentions both "PRP" and a feature to implement
- User requests a complete workflow including branch, implementation, and PR

Do NOT use this skill when:

- User only wants to run a single PRP command (e.g., just create a PRP)
- User is asking about PRP methodology (provide information instead)
- User wants to implement something without mentioning PRP workflow
