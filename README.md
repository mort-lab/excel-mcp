### 📋 Inventory Management
Track stock levels with real-time updates, conditional formatting for alerts, and automated reorder calculations.

### 📑 Data Migration
Read from old Excel files, clean and transform data, apply new formatting standards, and export to new structure.

## Examples

### Example 1: Formatted Sales Report

Ask Claude:
```
Create a sales report in sales_2024.xlsx with:
1. Headers: Date, Product, Quantity, Price, Total
2. Format headers: Bold, white text, blue background (#4472C4)
3. Add 10 sample sales entries with realistic data
4. Total column formula: =C2*D2 (for each row)
5. Format prices as currency: $#,##0.00
6. Add borders around all cells (thin, black)
7. Center-align all headers
8. Sum total sales in the last row with bold formatting
```

**Result:** Professional report with automatic calculations, fully formatted and ready to share.

### Example 2: Multi-Sheet Workbook

Ask Claude:
```
Create quarterly_report.xlsx with 5 sheets:
- Sheets: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Summary
- Each Q sheet has: Month, Revenue, Expenses, Profit
- Add 3 months of data per quarter
- Profit formula: =B2-C2
- Summary sheet with formulas that sum all quarters
- Format all currency values as $#,##0.00
```

**Result:** Complex multi-sheet workbook with cross-sheet formulas and comprehensive business report.

### Example 3: Data Migration

Ask Claude:
```
Read data from old_data.xlsx sheet 'Sales' range A1:E100,
then create new_data.xlsx with:
- Same data but sorted by date (column A)
- Add a new column F with 10% markup calculation (=E*1.1)
- Format dates as 'mm/dd/yyyy'
- Format currency columns as $#,##0.00
- Add bold headers with blue background
```

**Result:** Clean data migration enhanced with calculations and professional formatting.

## Performance

- **Fast**: Handles workbooks up to 10,000 rows efficiently
- **Memory**: ~50MB for typical operations
- **Lightweight**: No Excel installation required

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Create workbook | ~50ms | Empty workbook |
| Write 100 cells | ~200ms | Individual writes |
| Write 100 cells (range) | ~50ms | Bulk operation |
| Read 1000 cells | ~300ms | From existing file |
| Apply formatting | ~100ms | Per range |

## Limitations

- ❌ No chart/graph support (coming soon)
- ❌ No pivot tables (roadmap)
- ❌ No VBA macros (intentional - pure Python)
- ⚠️ File size limit: 100MB recommended

## FAQ

**Can I use this with Google Sheets?**
No, this server works exclusively with Excel (.xlsx) files.

**Does it work offline?**
Yes! When installed locally, it works completely offline.

**What Excel features are supported?**
- ✅ Formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, IF, VLOOKUP, COUNT, etc.)
- ✅ Formatting (fonts, colors, borders, alignment, number formats)
- ✅ Multiple sheets and workbooks
- ✅ Cell ranges and bulk operations
- ✅ Formula references across sheets
- ❌ Charts and graphs (roadmap)
- ❌ Pivot tables (roadmap)
- ❌ Macros/VBA (not planned - security)

**How large can my Excel files be?**
Recommended: Up to 100MB or ~50,000 rows for optimal performance.

**Can I use this in production?**
Yes! The server is tested and stable. Consider using Smithery for deployment and scaling.

## Troubleshooting

**Import Errors**
```bash
uv sync
```

**Permission Errors**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la /path/to/directory

# Fix permissions (Unix/Mac)
chmod u+w /path/to/directory
```

**File Already Exists**
When creating a workbook, if the file already exists, the operation will fail. Delete the existing file or use a different filename.
